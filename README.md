# SULI-LQCD
LQCD data-analysis code for my SULI 2020 summer program
Each file named after a correlation function (C2 Proton, C3 Axial Charge, C2 ProtonGG, etc.) parses LQCD data, calculates correlation functions and errors, and outputs to data files while each "plotter" file takes that data output and plots it.
